~~Or just download this repo as zip, rename it to `ChineseLocalization.sublime-package` and put it to `Data\Installed Packages`. (Sublime Text 3 only)~~ You need to unpack and pack it again to make sure all files in the zip root rather than `ChineseLocalization-st3` folder. Or just unzip them to `ChineseLocalization` folder in `Data/Packages` folder(You can open that folder by click main menu `Preferences\Browse Packages...`).

### problems

Now this problem has been solved at st3-1.6.0.

~~Because almost every package has a `Main.sublime-menu`, So some package name maybe override the Default one.~~

~~AFAIK, minimal manual delete including~~:

+ **SublimeREPL** delete caption

+ **Minify** Overwrite, but delete

+ **Tag** delete mnemonic caption

+ **Indent XML** delete caption Selection

+ **HTMLBeautify** delete caption Edit

+ **GraphvizPreview** delete caption Edit
