SublimeLinter 4.9
=================

You can now filter errors using regexes.

If your linter doesn't allow you to suppress some error types in its
configuration, or you just want your editor to be silent about some errors,
you can now filter in SublimeLinter. To do so, set the "filter_errors" setting
for a specific linter.
